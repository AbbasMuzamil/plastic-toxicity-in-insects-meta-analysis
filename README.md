## 📘 Abstract

<div align="justify">

Microplastics and nanoplastics are pervasive environmental pollutants infiltrating freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems worldwide. Despite increasing recognition of their ecological impacts, the effects of these particles on insect populations remain poorly understood. Insects, which are critical for pollination, decomposition, and nutrient cycling, are increasingly exposed to microplastics and nanoplastics, potentially leading to biological harm.

This study presents the first global meta-analysis evaluating the toxicity of microplastics and nanoplastics on insect health. Our findings reveal that microplastics significantly impair key biological traits, including survival (-1.17), growth (-0.69), development (-0.69), feeding (-0.68), fecundity (-0.47), and behavior (-0.24), with survival being the most severely affected. While nanoplastics also pose risks, their effects are generally less pronounced than those of microplastics. Moderator analyses show that plastic type, concentration, and exposure duration critically influence the severity of toxic effects, with higher concentrations and prolonged exposure leading to greater biological harm.

These results highlight the ecological risks posed by plastic pollution and the potential disruption of key ecosystem functions due to reduced insect fitness.
